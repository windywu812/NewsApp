# NewsApp

News App build with UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource and UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout, with MVVM Architecture, Combine Framework and Networking.

I'm interested on MVVM Architecture and want to learn more about that. That's why I make this as my project in NC3. I'm also learning and interested about combine framework, in that project I'll try to create data binding with this framework. This app is using API from https://newsapi.org to get the live data. Trying to implement MVVM Architecture in UIKit is a bit challenging, that also the reason why I want to learn this. :D
